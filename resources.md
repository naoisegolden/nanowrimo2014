## Historia

Chaval (niño?) en India (Bangalore?) debe iniciar un viaje a su pueblo (Assam?): ir a su boda, visitar abuela? En el inicio una niña/chica/mujer le encomienda llevar una planta (de te. lo sabe desde el principio?) hasta al final de su destino. Es muy importante!! En el trayecto, gente quiere quitarle la planta o evitar que llegue a su destino! Por que? que pasa?
Paralelamente hay un brote de vacas zombis diarrea que se inicia en Irlanda y estan causando estragos en el ecosistema y la gente muere.
La plaga que empieza en la historia como algo anecdotico se va extendiendo. Rumores, noticias, llega a India, psicosis tipo ebola, conspiranoia. Esta creando un mundo apocaliptico, arrasan con la vegetación.
Finalmente logra llegar a su pueblo y las vacas han arrasado con todas las plantaciones de te. Su familia no tiene modo de vida (eran cultivadores o exportadores de te).
La niña/mujer se le reaparece mágicamente, es la diosa china Tie GuanYin, y le explica la historia del monkey-pick tieguanyin y que la unica salvacion es que lleve el te a un templo en China.
Mas viaje y mas aventuras.
Paralelamente conocemos  la historia de un empresario irlandes que se vende cafe y esta muy frustrado porque nadie quiere cafe. Malo maloso psicotico que se siente ninguneado y cree que todo el mundo deberia beber cafe en lugar de te.
El bien y el mal, te y cafe?
Este irlandes es el malo de la pelicula. El que intenta a toda costa que la planta no llegue a su destino.
Finalmente hay un cara a cara cuando el chaval consigue llegar al templo. Ahi se desvela la conexion  entre el irlandes y la apocalipsis vaca. El irlandes ha creado un virus para que las vacas de India (Sri Lanka?) que es de donde sale el te irlandes, acaben con el te para que la gente tome cafe. Se le escapo en Irlanda y ahi empezo la apocalispis vaca.

Falta:
* problemas por el camino

## Ubicaciones

Monkey coffee is made in Chickmagalur, India. Chickmagalur is located in India's state of Karnataka, which is known for its mountains and beaches, as well as its coffee-production in Coorg, a picturesque, higher elevation portion of Karnataka. The area is lush, green and hilly with heavy rainfall and enough coffee plantations to comprise 60 percent of India's total coffee production. The coffee farms are sometimes located alongside forests and other times interspersed with other plants in variations on shade-grown coffee and / or permaculture. Rhesus monkeys inhabit the forests and visit the coffee plantations fairly often. [Fuente](http://coffeetea.about.com/od/coffeebasics/a/Monkey-Coffee.htm).

The origin of Monkey Picked oolong tea dates to the early 18th century, when the Tie Guan Yin varietal of tea plant was discovered in Anxi county of Fujian province. Legend has it that monkeys were trained by monks to pick the choicest leaves from wild tea trees growing in the Wuyi Mountains of Fujian Province.

## Hinduismo 

Los textos hinduistas organizaban la vida humana en cuatro objetivos: rectitud (dharma), bienes (artha), placer (kama) y liberación (moksa). Los tres primeros son busquedas terrenales inferiores al ultimo, liberación de este mundo. 

karma: universal law cause in effect

rebirth & reincarnation

dharma: necessity righteaous living

we are bhrama, but we don't know it because vail of maya, once enlightment (moksa) we merge with god, the atman

Trimurti, is a concept in Hinduism "in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified by the forms of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the maintainer or preserver and Shiva the destroyer or transformer." These three gods have been called "the Hindu triad"[3] or the "Great Trinity",[4] often addressed as "Brahma-Vishnu-Maheshwara." They are different forms of the One person called the Supreme Being or Svayam Bhagavan/Lord Krishna/Parabrahman.

God Brahma represents the creative aspect, god Vishnu the preservative aspect and god Shiva the destructive aspect of the Supreme Spirit. Goddess Saraswathy represents the knowledge, goddess Lakshmi represents wealth and god Ganesha is worshipped for removing the obstacles in the path of life. Every Hindu has the spiritual freedom to select any of the aspects of the Supreme Brahman which satisfies his spiritual craving. In Hindu religion idol is termed as “vigraha” which means ‘to grasp firmly’ or as “moorti” meaning ‘materialization’. So vigraha is a symbolic representation which helps the mind to grasp firmly the abstract idea of God.

Worship of god in Hinduism is called “Pooja” (veneration). Pooja can be performed either at home or at temple. It is not obligatory for a Hindu to visit temple or perform pilgrimage. Most of the Hindus perform pooja every morning and/ or evening after bath. Clean dress, clean body and clean mind are necessary. Cleaning or purification with water is a common practice. Every temple has pond and those who visiting the temple are required to take bath in the pond before entering the temple. Currently this practice had been replaced with symbolic washing of feet, hands and face.

Pooja usually include lighting of oil lamps, incense and camphor and offering of flowers, fruits and food. Pooja may be observed with silence or with prayers.

The basic concepts of Hinduism are:

* belief in the one Supreme Spirit as the universal soul, referred to as Brahman.
* belief in the individual soul of every living thing, referred to as Atman.
* all living things go through a cycle of birth and re- birth.
* the universe itself undergoes endless cycles of creation, preservation and dissolution.
* the status of the being in each birth is determined by the quality of “Karma” (right action) of the previous life.
* one can not alter his past life but can mould the next life by purifying karma of this life.
* the chain of birth- rebirth can be broken by self realization- the knowledge that one’s own Atman is not indistinct from Brahman.
* through self realization, the being can attain “Moksha” (liberation).

Hence, self realization is the ultimate goal in the life of a Hindu. The methods or paths (“Yogas”) by which one can attain the goal are:

* Bhakti yoga – through love and devotion for god.
* Karma yoga – through the righteous and responsible actions or duties.
* Raja yoga – through meditation.
* Jnana yoga – through knowledge and wisdom.
* According to Hindu religious system, every human life has four specific stages or phases. These phases are known by the name “Ashramas”.

Brahmacharya- the first phase of life involves living and studying with guru (teacher) in gurukula (school). This is the student life. Students shall have a life of simplicity and celibacy.
Grihastha- after the student life, the second phase starts with marriage. This is the life of a householder, in which one has to support his parents, his own family and guests.
Vanaprastha- this is the retirement phase, when duties of child rearing and other responsibilities are over. Duties are handed over to children and most of the time is spent for religious works.
Sanyasa- the final phase in which one is totally withdrawn from the physical world. Most of the time is spent in meditation and finally sheds the body for moksha (liberartion).

## Sadhus

In Hinduism, a sādhu (Sanskrit: साधु sādhu, "good; good man, holy man") is a religious ascetic or holy person.[1] Although the vast majority of sādhus are yogīs, not all yogīs are sādhus. The sādhu is solely dedicated to achieving mokṣa (liberation), the fourth and final aśrama (stage of life), through meditation and contemplation of brahman. Sādhus often wear saffron-coloured clothing, symbolising their sanyāsa (renunciation).

Sometimes feared for their curses. It is also thought that the austere practices of the sadhus help to burn off their karma and that of the community at large. Thus seen as benefiting society, sadhus are supported by donations from many people.

There are two primary sectarian divisions within the sadhu community: Shaiva sadhus, ascetics devoted to Shiva, and Vaishnava sadhus, renouncers devoted to Vishnu and/or his incarnations, which include Rama and Krishna. 

 Such practices as the obligatory early morning bath in the cold mountains require a detachment from common luxuries. After the bath, sadhus gather around the dhuni, or holy fireplace, and begin with their prayers and meditation for the day.

Some sadhus dispense cures to the local community, remove evil eyes or bless a marriage. They are a walking reminder to the average Hindu of Divinity. They are generally allowed free passage on the trains and are a close-knit organisation.

Sadhus occupy a unique and important place in Hindu society, particularly in villages and small towns more closely tied to tradition. In addition to bestowing religious instruction and blessings to lay people, sadhus are often called upon to adjudicate disputes between individuals or to intervene in conflicts within families. Sadhus are also living embodiments of the divine, images of what human life, in the Hindu view, is truly about – religious illumination and liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
